# 0MHz Collection

This is a simple collection of scripts and configurations that, when pointed to a directory of preconfigured VHD files will produce dedicated MGL files for the MiSTer FPGA system.

It gives you a top-level `DOS Games` configuration, and lets you have on virtual hard drive (VHD) for each game, making it easy to cherry-pick just the games you want to have available.

The goal of the project isn't to cover every single DOS game ever released — see exoDOS and Flynn's Top 300 packs for MiSTer if you want that — but rather the most popular and well-regarded DOS games that are able to run on MiSTer's `ao486` core.
